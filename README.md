## 🏗 Architecture

- **Componets**: presentational UI
- **Hooks**: state and side effects
- **api**: API communication
- **constants**: configuration and endpoints
- 📝 **Reusable components**: In this version I focused on creating, managing, and implementing reusable components. I understood why React’s component-based approach speeds up development and improves maintainability. The application’s design is now practically complete, except for the pagination component which will be implemented in a future version.
- 📝 **Theme handling**: I experimented with a custom hook for light/dark theme management. Although I decided not to keep dark mode due to visual inconsistencies, the experience taught me how to handle theme switching, which will be useful for future projects.
- 📝 **LocalStorage**: I chose not to implement local storage since this app is primarily for displaying data (characters, filters, pagination) rather than persisting user-generated content. This keeps the focus on building a clean and interactive dashboard.
- 📝 Pagination will be added in a future release once the logic is ready.
